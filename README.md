## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with **LLMtoSLM**:

### 1. Installation
Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install llmtoslm
```

### 2. Quick Start
Fine-tune your first model with a few lines of code:

```python
from llmtoslm import FineTuner

# Initialize the fine-tuner with your chosen model
fine_tuner = FineTuner(model_name='openai-gpt3')

# Fine-tune the model on your dataset
fine_tuned_model = fine_tuner.fine_tune(dataset='your_dataset.csv')

# Save the fine-tuned model
fine_tuned_model.save('path_to_save_model')
```

### 3. Integration
Integrate the fine-tuned model into your application:

```python
from llmtoslm import ModelLoader

# Load the fine-tuned model
model = ModelLoader.load('path_to_saved_model')

# Use the model for inference
result = model.predict('Your input text here')
print(result)
```
